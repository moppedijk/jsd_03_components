## Synopsis

The aim of generating an component library and style guide for this project was to create an development environment which is easy to maintain. This style guide needs to be developed for reuse like for example Bootstrap. But what's the difference between an component library and an style guide?

In developing this part of the project we looked at some tools:
- Pattern primer (https://github.com/adactio/Pattern-Primer)
- Documented Style Sheets Parser (https://github.com/DSSWG/DSS)
- Fabricator (https://fbrctr.github.io/)
- Living Style Guide Gem (https://livingstyleguide.org/)
- Sourcejs (https://sourcejs.com/)
- Pattern lab (http://patternlab.io/)
- BEM tools (https://en.bem.info/toolbox/)
