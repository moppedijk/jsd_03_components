# Component Libraries & Style Guides

This git repository is the third part of a larger project.
This larger project aims at developing web-applications with open data which are easy to maintaint due to the use of component lib's and styleguides. Below links to all the git repositories:
- [jsd_01_kickstart] (https://github.com/moppedijk/jsd_01_kickstart)
- [jsd_02_application] (https://github.com/moppedijk/jsd_02_application)
- [jsd_03_components] (https://github.com/moppedijk/jsd_03_components)

## Synopsis

The aim of generating an component library and style guide for this project was to create an development environment which is easy to maintain. This style guide needs to be developed for reuse like for example Bootstrap. But what's the difference between an component library and an style guide?

In developing this part of the project we looked at some tools:
- Pattern primer (on Node) (https://github.com/squashvoice/Pattern-Primer-on-Node)
- Documented Style Sheets Parser (https://github.com/DSSWG/DSS)
- Fabricator (https://fbrctr.github.io/)
- Living Style Guide Gem (https://livingstyleguide.org/)
- Sourcejs (https://sourcejs.com/)
- Pattern lab (http://patternlab.io/)
- BEM tools (https://en.bem.info/toolbox/)

## Code Example

For code examples see different folders in repository.

## Motivation

I teste a few tools for generating components and style guides and there are some differences and some similarities. I test the tools with a few HTML components like buttons, inputs and headings. See the different folders for reference.

### Pattern primer

This tool is realy simple but not really usefull for this project in combination with Meteorjs. This is a good tool if you want to create a preview of components for a client but it does not fit with the Meteor development flow. Meteorjs devides all the html and css into small components in combination with other styles. Pattern primer only works with one css file and that's not I want.

I tested the Nodejs and Grunt versions and they did not work on my computer.
